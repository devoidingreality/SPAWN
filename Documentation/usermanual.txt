	a. Non-integer teleports (the act of teleporting any object to coordinates whose
X and/or Y values are not whole numbers) can yield unpredictable and unexpected results,
most commonly partial temporal misalignment of body segments. Operators are strongly
advised not to execute non-integer teleports while any organic matter is making
sustained contact with the touchscreen.

	b. Any object making direct contact with a Terminal's touchscreen; and by
extension, any objects making direct contact with those objects, and so on,
will also be teleported.

	c. Teleports will fail if any X or Y coordinate is greater than 100. This can be
bypassed by teleporting multiple times within quick succession.

                                    What is Included
                 ------------------------------------------------------

	All FastTravel points ("Terminals") are bundled with a modified installation of
Microsoft Windows 95 with an added touchscreen. The repository for this modified
installation can be found at [link removed].

	Installations were downgraded from Microsoft Windows 10 to reduce system overhead
and minimize latency. Incompatibilities in later operating systems have also been
observed. However, later interface layers are emulated or preserved for operator
familiarity and legacy compatibility.

                     How to Use Dimension I-�� FastTravel Software
                 ------------------------------------------------------

	Approach a Terminal; the LCD will turn on in response to proximity. In the rare
case a Terminal's screen won't turn on or is unnaturally dim, restart it by pressing the
Restart button to the LCD's right. If the issue persists, it is likely faulty. In that
case, contact a repair technician by e-mailing maintenance@the-interstice.org and providing
your coordinates, as shown in your Personal Digital Assistant (Which you have assumedly been
provided upon entering Dimension I-��.)

	When the Terminal is on, you will be greeted by a menu ("Window") named 
"FastTravel.exe." On the window are multiple VBA CommandButtons ("Buttons") and TextBoxes
("Text boxes"), all of which will be highlighted in this following section:

	                          ==== Commands ====
        Buttons:
     1. TP button    - Its caption stands for "Teleport." Upon typing coordinates into the
	               X and Y text boxes, tapping this button will transport any object or
                       organism making (any and all) contact with the touchscreen. (Warnings
                       and Safety Notices, B.)

     2. ? (question) - This is the user manual button. The Terminal will display a copy of
	               document upon tapping it. It can then be closed by tapping the X
	               button in the top-right corner of the displayed Notepad window.

     3. C button     - Similarly, the Terminal will display a copy of the GNU General Public
	               License version 3 upon tapping it. It can be closed the same way.

	Text boxes:
     1. X coordinate - Related to Coordinates. Read the Room Unit section for more information.
	               Input your desired X coordinate.
     
     2. Y coordinate - Ditto. Input your desired Y coordinate.


	                        ==== Room Unit ====

	Generally, one Room ("Ru") is measured as a 72x72 stud area. Room coordinates are
expressed as a dictionary in the form { X = %d, Y = %d }, where "%d" represents an
integer (whole number). This means that inputting 50 on the X text box and -100 on the
Y text box will teleport you to { X = 50, Y = -100 }.

	At the moment, teleports will only succeed if you enter integers that are divisible by
10 without the help of "external add-ons." This is because Terminals can only transport
objects to other Terminals; and Terminals can only be present at { X % 10 == 0, Y % 10 == 0 }.

	The program will not crash if you input a float (decimal number) into any
text box (for example: { X = -2.5, Y = 5.5 }). See Warnings and Safety Notices, A.

	Due to limitations, Terminals can only transport objects to Terminals within 100
Ru in any axis for each teleport. Certain "external add-ons" may make optimizations
that can loosen or remove this restriction. This does not stop or disallow teleporting
more than 100 Ru by FastTraveling in bursts. (Warnings and Safety Notices, C.)


	    			 ==== Reference Implementation ====

	The reference implementation demonstrates safe canonical conversion only; the
Terminal runtime does not enforce rounding.

	Ru can be converted to Vector3 and CFrame with this function:
	--
	local function ToWorld(Ru: { X: number, Y: number }, y: number?, m: string?): (CFrame | Vector3)
		local Ru = Ru or { X = 0, Y = 0 }
		local y = y or 0
		local m = m or "Vector3"
		
		if Ru.X ~= Ru.X then
			warn("Ru.X is not a number")
			Ru.X = 0
		end
		if Ru.Y ~= Ru.Y then
			warn("Ru.Y is not a number")
			Ru.Y = 0
		end
		
		Ru.X = math.round(Ru.X)
		Ru.Y = math.round(Ru.Y)
		
		Ru.X *= 72
		Ru.Y *= 72

		return m == "Vector3" and Vector3.new(Ru.X, y, Ru.Y) or CFrame.new(Ru.X, y, Ru.Y)
	end
	--
	And vice-versa:
	--
	local function ToRoom(World: CFrame | Vector3): ({ X: number, Y: number }, number)
		if typeof(World) ~= "Vector3" and typeof(World) ~= "CFrame" then
			warn("invalid data type", typeof(World))
			return
		end
		
		local x, y = World.X, World.Z
		local yWorld = World.Y

		x /= 72
		y /= 72

		x = math.round(x)
		y = math.round(y)

		return { X = x, Y = y }, yWorld
	end
	--
