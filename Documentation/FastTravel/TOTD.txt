You can type in <b>+[number]</b> or <b>-[number]</b> to add or subtract from your coordinates.

Typing in a <i>decimal number</i> under any TextBox will not end well.

A <b>Terminal</b> can only exist at coordinates <i>divisible by 10</i>.

You can not <b>FastTravel</b> any further than 100 rooms.

You can only <b>FastTravel</b> to other Terminals.

Read the documentation. It's accessed by pressing the <b>?</b> button.

Get off this god damn Terminal and travel the old-fashioned way.

This generation is too soft to use their own legs these days...



You may or may not be able to find <i>hidden items</i> to upgrade your <b>Personal Digital Assistant</b>.

Your <b>Personal Digital Assistant</b> will emit a <i>high-pitched sound</i> in close proximity to an item.

Sick of walking so slow? Perhaps you should try at finding a pair <b>Hermes' Boots</b>; It's somewhere near <b>{ X = 0, Y = 0 }</b>.

Gaze into your reflection in a <b>Magic Mirror</b> to return to <b>{ X = 0, Y = 0 }</b> and create a wormhole to your initial position.

Beware of using <i>"dubious"</i> items...!

Some engineer left us the <b>EXO Boots</b>... though, it requires a <i>certain pair of green boots</i> to snatch it.

Need some quality of life? The <b>Portal Skirt</b> allows you to teleport to and from <b><i>any</i></b> room.

You can make your <b>Personal Digital Assistant</b> happy by upgrading it into the <b>Interstitial-Grade PDA</b>. Though, it requires a little, <i>too many</i> ingredients...

Your <b>Personal Digital Assistant</b> enjoys the <b>Portal Skirt</b> out of all the items. Now you know.

Have you ever heard of <b>Dark Souls</b>? <b>Prime Souls</b>? Well, discard that knowledge. It does not help in this case. You can find souls by returning to the <b>Terminal</b> at <b>{ X = 0, Y = 0 }</b> and inserting a <b>Tier 1</b> and <b>Tier 2</b> item of the same category.

Perhaps if you could just bring a <b>Terminal</b> around with you... though, Terminals are real heavy. What if you brought some, conglomerate version of its CPU instead?

Ever wanted to parkour? Someone made that. It gets you a sick <i>pair of mechanical boots</i>. Just go to <b>{ X = 77, Y = 77 }</b>!

go to <b>{ X = 13, Y = 37 }</b> for a surprise :3 -r

Need some mystery in your cold, dark life? How about you take a look at the <b>Dubious Circuitry</b>? It'll throw you across the grid.

The <b>Magical Circuit Heart</b> helps lots, combining the functionalities of a <i>magical shard of glass</i> and a <i>suspicious-looking circuit board</i>...

The <i>souls of the damned</i> lend their combined power to you. As clothing you can wear. Guess they weren't so evil after all...

What if you found some weird non-Euclidean way to fix up your <b>Personal Digital Assistant</b> using a little over ten different things?



Only the brave, or the reckless, try at confronting one of the two builders.

Yes, some say there were two builders of this place... the <b>Woman of Time</b> and her younger brother, the <b>Man of Moonspawn</b>.

The two builders wield two special tools: a <i>pink landmine</i> and a standard set of <i>building tools</i>.

The <i>pink landmine</i>. They called it the <b>Subspace Tripmine</b>. 
 
Some speculate the <b>Woman of Time</b> has returned under the identity of that engineer at <b>{ X = 13, Y = 37 }</b>, despite her explicitly denying all claims. 
 
Don't you ever wonder what happens at <b>{ X = 9223373036854775807, Y = 9223373036854775807 }</b>? Too bad you'll never be able to get there, right? 
 
 
 
What kind of engineer puts in the time and effort to remodel multiple rooms? 
 
<b>Red herrings</b>? Pfft, I could never!
