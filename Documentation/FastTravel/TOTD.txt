You can type <b>+[number]</b> or <b>-[number]</b> to add or subtract from your coordinates.

Typing in a <i>decimal number</i> under any TextBox will not end well.

A <b>Terminal</b> can only exist at coordinates <i>divisible by 10</i>.

You can not <b>FastTravel</b> any further than 100 rooms.

You can only <b>FastTravel</b> to other Terminals.

Read the documentation. It's the <b>?</b> button.

Get off this god damn Terminal and travel the old-fashioned way.

This generation is too soft to use their own legs these days...



You may or may not be able to find <i>hidden items</i> to upgrade your <b>Personal Digital Assistant</b>.

Your <b>Personal Digital Assistant</b> will emit a <i>high-pitched sound</i> in close proximity to an item.

Sick of walking so slow? Perhaps you should try at finding a pair <b>Hermes' Boots</b>; It's somewhere near <b>{ X = 0, Y = 0 }</b>.

Gaze into your reflection in a <b>Magic Mirror</b> to return to <b>{ X = 0, Y = 0 }</b> and create a wormhole to your initial position.

Beware of using <i>"dubious"</i> items...!

Some cosmic engineer left us the <b>EXO Boots</b>... though, it requires a <i>certain pair of green boots</i> to snatch it.

Need some quality of life? The <b>Portal Skirt</b> allows you to teleport to and from <b><i>any</i></b> room.

You can make your <b>Personal Digital Assistant</b> happy by upgrading it into the <b>Interstitial-Grade PDA</b>. Though, it requires a little, <i>too many</i> ingredients...

Your <b>Personal Digital Assistant</b> enjoys the <b>Portal Skirt</b> out of all the items. Now you know.

Have you ever heard of <b>Dark Souls</b>? Well, discard that knowledge... it doesn't help. You can find souls by returning to the <b>Terminal</b> at <b>{ X = 0, Y = 0 }</b> and inserting a <b>Tier 1</b> and <b>Tier 2</b> item of the same category.

Perhaps if you could just bring a <b>Terminal</b> around with you... though, Terminals are real heavy. What if you brought its CPU instead?

Ever wanted to parkour? Someone made that. It gets you a sick <i>pair of mechanical boots</i>. Just go to <b>{ X = 77, Y = 77 }</b>!

go to <b>{ X = 13, Y = 37 }</b> for a surprise :3 -r

Need some mystery in your cold, dark life? How about you take a look at the <b>Dubious Circuitry</b>? It'll throw you across the grid.

The <b>Magical Circuit Heart</b> helps lots, combining the functionalities of a <i>magical shard of glass</i> and a <i>suspicious-looking circuit boaard</i>...

The <i>souls of the damned</i> lend their combined power to you. As clothing you can wear. Guess they weren't so evil after all...

What if you found some weird non-Euclidean way to fix up your <b>Personal Digital Assistant</b> using a little over ten different things?



Only the brave, or the reckless, try at confronting one of the two builders.

Some say there were two builders of this place... the <b>Woman of Time</b> and her brother, the <b>Man of Spawn</b>.

The two builders wield two special tools: a <i>pink landmine</i> and a standard set of <i>building tools</i>.

Don't you ever wonder what happens at <b>{ X = 2147483647, Y = 2147483647 }</b>? Too bad you'll never be able to get there, right?



What kind of engineer puts in the time and effort to remodel multiple rooms?

<b>Red herrings</b>? Pfft, I could never.

goo goobie

There's something behind the tree.

<b>The Spawn</b>

<b>Did you know?</b> He is <i>always</i> watching.

<b>Terminals</b> actually have organs under the floor. Why don't you check.

<b>Dimension I-��</b> is endless and any attempts at finding an end will be fruitless.

Your <b>Personal Digital Assistant</b> wants to talk to you.

Cogito, ergo sum. <b>I think, therefore I am. <i>I AM.</i></b>

Not all mysteries were meant to be solved.

I have no mouth and I must scream.

Don't you ever wonder who made this place?

The answer is beneath us...

I was in hell, looking at heaven. I was machine, and you were flesh.



<b>The Cyber Grind</b>? What's that?

<b>Prime Sanctum</b>? What's that?

<b>Allied Mastercomputer</b>? What's that?

<b>Aperture Science</b>? What's that?

The person reading this is wearing <i>black headphones</i>. That's right, <b>Jonathan</b>. I can see you behind the screen.

Jonathan, what's your head look like without those weird headphones?

Hey, Jonathan. How big is that head dent after wearing those headphones for so long?
