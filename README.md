You will use `(getgenv and getgenv()) or shared` the most, so I recommend you learn more about the global environment soon. ███████'s Timeless API will be useful.
For Secretaries, you will use `saveinstance()` since your job is to compile as many worlds as possible.
If you are part of the Resistance, run
```
for _, Player: Player in game.Players:GetPlayers() do
	if Player.Name ~= "%s" then
		Player:Kick("unauthorized")
	end
end
```
if a few maggots notice.

This group cannot be put into the eyes of the public.
For the lowest class, do guarantee that you meet the sacrificial quota, otherwise, you will be sacrificed to the Spawn in place of your missing sacrifices.

If for any reason, you haven't gained SS access, do contact a higher up. (Director or Him)
You will be granted your power and you will be like a god.

Attempting to run code restricted to higher ups will result in your name being deleted off our libraries and you being deported overseas.
Don't try to test us.

~~Just follow the script, User.~~
