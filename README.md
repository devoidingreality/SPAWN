You will use `(getgenv and getgenv()) or shared` the most, so I recommend you learn more about the global environment soon.
For Secretaries, you will use `saveinstance()` to compile the world you're in.
If you are part of the Resistance, run
```
for _, Player: Player in game.Players:GetPlayers() do
	Player:Kick("You are in the utmost presence of ���.")
end
```
when you believe is necessary.

This group cannot be put into the eyes of the public.
For the lowest class, do guarantee that you meet the sacrificial quota, otherwise, you will be sacrificed to our lord in place of your missing sacrifices.

If for any reason you haven't gained SS access, do contact a higher up. (Director or Him)
You will be granted your power and you will be like a god.

Attempting to run code restricted to higher ups will result in your name being deleted off our libraries and you being deported overseas.
Don't try to test us.

~~Just follow the script, User.~~
